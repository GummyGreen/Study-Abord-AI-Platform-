# visa-guidance/app.py
#
# A simple Flask chatbot for visa guidance:
#  1. Loads data from ../data/visa_requirements.json
#  2. Expects a POST /chat with JSON: { "user_query": "..." }
#  3. Uses naive keyword matching to figure out which country the user is asking about,
#     and whether they're asking about 'steps' or 'documents'.
#  4. Returns the relevant info in a "reply" field of the JSON response.
#
# Example user queries:
#   - "How do I get a US student visa?"
#   - "Which documents do I need for Canada?"
#   - "What is the process for F-1?"
#
# Adapt or expand for real-world usage.
